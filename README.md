# IP GET Logger DB

The database of malicious/suspicious GET requests for use in the [IP GET Logger](https://github.com/pekarskyi/ip-get-logger) plugin.

The plugin does not track or collect anonymous data about websites, users, or requests.
If you discover new malicious GET requests, please inform me so that I can add them to the request database.
